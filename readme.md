## Description
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). This project entails building a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

## Technologies

* [mysql2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2)
* [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
* [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
* [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table)

## Challenges
